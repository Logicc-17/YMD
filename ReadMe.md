# 💫 About Me:
### Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile!<br><br>I'm [Your Name], a curious-minded developer who loves exploring tech and breaking things (so I can fix them even better)! 😄 Currently, I'm a third-year Network Security student 🕵️‍♂️🔐, and I've dabbled in areas ranging from machine learning to cryptography. Here, you'll find my coding experiments, projects, and maybe even a few surprise bugs! 🐞<br><br>**🔎 What I’m up to:**<br>- 🚀 Building an anime streaming website (yes, I take binge-watching seriously 🍿)<br>- 🤖 Exploring data science by scraping, cleaning, and training models<br>- 🔐 Diving deep into security concepts and creating real-world challenges<br><br>**💡 Fun Facts:**<br>- I can dedicate four hours straight to problem-solving but don't ask me to pick a favorite programming language… they're all fun in their own way! 🚀<br>- I’m studying TLS, VPNs, and firewalls, and still, I’ve never actually watched *Mr. Robot* 😅<br><br>**🛠️ Skill Set:**<br>- **Languages & Tools:** Python, SQL, PHP, Jupyter Notebook, Assembly, Networking Tools<br>- **Current Focus:** Machine learning, secure web apps, data security practices<br>- **Other Skills:** Brawlhalla fan with a knack for choosing unarmed characters like Val and Vraxx (no axe? No problem!)<br><br>**📬 Let’s Connect!**<br>If you're into tech, anime, or just curious about data science, feel free to reach out or fork one of my projects! Cheers to learning and building cool stuff together!<br><br>*P.S. I'm currently watching *One Piece*, but no spoilers, please! 🏴‍☠️*<br>
